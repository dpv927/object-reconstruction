# Object reconstruction

## Overview

This project aims to reconstruct simple 3D objects from their 2D orthographic projections. The program can take multiple views of the
object like its plan, profile, and elevation and then try to generate a 3D representation of the object in an orthographic space.

One limitation of the programme is that objects with transversal gaps are not correctly reconstructed, as the gaps at this point are
not possible to be detected by the program.
